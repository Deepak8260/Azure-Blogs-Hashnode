### **Let‚Äôs Begin With a Simple Thought ‚Äì Why Virtualization**

A physical server or even a standard laptop is typically limited to running a single operating system at a time. For instance, by default, it's not possible to run Windows and Linux simultaneously on the same physical machine.

However, this limitation can be overcome through virtualization technologies such as VMware or similar platforms. These tools enable the simultaneous operation of multiple operating systems on a single physical device, making use of virtualization techniques behind the scenes.

This marks the essence of virtualization ‚Äî a method that expands the capabilities of physical systems by allowing them to perform tasks that were previously restricted or impossible.

### **What Exactly Is Virtualization?**

So let‚Äôs define it :

**‚ÄúIt is the technique of splitting physical resources into logical resources.‚Äù**

That‚Äôs it. Simple line.

When you apply virtualization on a **physical server**, you get multiple **logical environments** on the same hardware. And each of these environments behaves like a complete standalone machine.

### **Let's Take a Practical Example:**

Take your **laptop**. Normally, you install one OS ‚Äì Windows.

But what if you also want to run **Linux** alongside it?

* You can‚Äôt do it natively.
    
* You can dual boot, but only one OS runs at a time.
    

But with virtualization, using tools like VMware or VirtualBox, you can **run Linux inside Windows**. That Linux OS believes it‚Äôs on its own computer. But no! It‚Äôs inside your laptop. That‚Äôs virtualization.

So, this process where:

* You create **multiple environments** (Linux, RedHat, Ubuntu)
    
* On a **single piece of hardware** (your laptop)
    
* And all run **simultaneously**, independently
    

This is **virtualization in real life**.

### **Let‚Äôs Translate That to Real Servers:**

What we just discussed applies in a data center too.

In an enterprise, you can take a physical server and apply virtualization. This way, one physical server can host:

* 10 virtual servers
    
* Each with their own OS and applications
    

And it saves money. Instead of buying 10 physical servers, you **run 10 virtual ones** on a single machine.

Now comes the main player here ‚Äì the **hypervisor**.

### **What Is a Hypervisor?**

When you want to virtualize your physical machine, you need a piece of software. This is called a **hypervisor**.

What does it do?

* It **sits on top of your physical server**
    
* It lets you create, run, and manage virtual machines
    
* It **allocates resources** to VMs (like RAM, CPU, storage)
    

There are two types of hypervisors:

#### **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal):**

* Installed directly on the physical machine
    
* Doesn‚Äôt need an underlying OS
    
* Much more powerful and secure
    
* Used in real-world production environments
    

| Cloud Platform | Hypervisor Type |
| --- | --- |
| Azure | Hyper-V |
| AWS | Xen, Nitro |
| VMware | ESXi |

#### **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted):**

* Installed on top of an existing operating system
    
* Suitable for training or learning
    
* Used on laptops for testing
    

Examples:

* VMware Workstation
    
* Oracle VirtualBox
    

But let me be very clear: **In real cloud computing**, **we use Type 1 only**.

For more, refere to this blog [https://kdazureblogs.hashnode.dev/day1-introduction-to-cloud-computing](https://kdazureblogs.hashnode.dev/day1-introduction-to-cloud-computing)

## **Scaling Virtualization to a Data Center ‚Äì The Cloud Backbone**

So far, we have understood what virtualization is.

We‚Äôve seen how, using a hypervisor on our personal laptop or system, we can create multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each of these virtual machines can run its own operating system, its own applications, and work independently ‚Äî all inside a single physical device like a laptop.

This means, instead of needing three different laptops to run Windows, Ubuntu, and RedHat Linux separately, you can just have one good laptop, and run all three **together** using virtualization.

This is great for learning and development ‚Äî but now comes the real question:

What happens when we apply this idea at a **much larger scale**?

Let‚Äôs now take this concept ‚Äî the idea of virtualization ‚Äî and **move it from your laptop to a real-world cloud data center**, like the ones used by **Microsoft Azure**, **Amazon AWS**, or **Google Cloud**.

### **What Is a Data Center?**

A **data center** is a huge physical building ‚Äî sometimes as large as a football stadium ‚Äî built specifically to host thousands and thousands of powerful computers. These computers are not ordinary ones like our laptops; they are **special enterprise-grade physical servers**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754501675686/006ac17b-0406-4da6-8959-ee9c2e220335.png align="center")

If you could walk into such a data center, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd see:

* The entire space is filled with **metal racks**.
    
* Each rack holds **multiple physical servers**, stacked one over another.
    
* There are **rows and rows of these racks**, running all the time.
    
* There are blinking lights, cooling fans, and a deep humming sound in the background ‚Äî the sound of the cloud working silently behind the scenes.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754501692997/d4ad0523-1868-4d65-a19d-f2adbbcb5530.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754501796819/8f3798ae-4e37-448a-bedb-336583721858.png align="center")

This building is kept cool with air conditioning, protected by security, monitored 24x7, and connected to the fastest internet lines available.

### **Now Imagine This‚Ä¶**

Let‚Äôs say Microsoft has one such data center, and it has **10,000 physical servers** inside.

Each server:

* Has massive RAM ‚Äî maybe 1 TB (terabyte)
    
* Dozens of CPUs ‚Äî even 128 cores
    
* High-speed SSD storage ‚Äî several terabytes
    

Now, by default, each of these servers can run **only one operating system** at a time ‚Äî just like your laptop.

But that would be a complete waste of resources, right? Why run only one program or one OS on such a powerful machine?

So here‚Äôs what Microsoft does‚Ä¶

### **Applying Virtualization in the Data Center**

Microsoft installs a **hypervisor** on each of those physical servers.

Yes ‚Äî the same hypervisor concept you learned earlier. But this time, it's not the Type 2 version (used for learning). It‚Äôs the real one ‚Äî **Type 1 hypervisor**, like **Hyper-V** in Microsoft‚Äôs case.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754501814198/9047e7c6-b877-45fe-a94a-01d2074380cf.jpeg align="center")

Once the hypervisor is installed, each of these physical servers becomes a **Virtualization Host**.

Now what happens?

This one single physical server can now run **multiple virtual machines** ‚Äî just like your laptop did, but now at an enterprise level.

Here‚Äôs an example:

Suppose one of these servers has:

* 1 TB (1024 GB) RAM
    
* 128 CPU cores
    
* 10 TB SSD storage
    

Using the hypervisor, Microsoft can create:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754501824278/7edbe775-d386-4e11-af84-a77a3a2e7b00.png align="center")

* 100 virtual machines on this one server
    
* Each VM can be assigned:
    
    * 8 GB or 16 GB RAM
        
    * 2 or 4 virtual CPUs
        
    * 100 GB of storage
        
* Each VM runs its own operating system ‚Äî Linux, Windows, Ubuntu, RedHat, etc.
    

So what‚Äôs the result?

A single physical machine becomes **home to 100+ virtual machines**, and all of them are running **simultaneously**, completely isolated from one another.

### **Who Uses These Virtual Machines?**

Now you may wonder ‚Äî who is using these virtual machines?

Here comes the most important part.

Each of these virtual machines is being **rented by a customer**.

Let‚Äôs say:

* One VM is being used by a software company to host their website.
    
* Another VM is used by a startup to run a backend application.
    
* Another one is used by a bank for storing customer transactions.
    
* One might be a Linux server for a data science student.
    
* Another might be a Windows server for hosting an ERP system.
    

And all these VMs are running **on the same physical server** in the data center ‚Äî yet they never interfere with each other.

They‚Äôre completely isolated, secure, and feel like **individual computers** to their respective users.

That‚Äôs the magic of virtualization at scale.

### **What Happens When You Click ‚ÄúCreate Virtual Machine‚Äù on Azure?**

Now let‚Äôs come to you.

You are sitting at your home or office.

You open your laptop, go to a browser, and open this website:  
üëâ [`https://portal.azure.com`](https://portal.azure.com)

You log in to your Azure account.

From there, you click on ‚ÄúCreate a Virtual Machine.‚Äù

Azure now shows you options to select:

* Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows Server)
    
* Size of the machine (e.g., DS1 v2, 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM)
    
* Region (e.g., Southeast Asia, West Europe)
    
* Username, Password
    
* Storage settings
    
* Network settings
    

You fill in all details and click **Create**.

Now what happens behind the scenes?

1. Your request goes through the internet to Microsoft Azure‚Äôs cloud control system.
    
2. Azure looks into its available data centers and finds a **physical server** that has enough free resources.
    
3. It picks a suitable host machine.
    
4. It launches the hypervisor on that server to **create a new virtual machine** for you.
    
5. That machine is given your requested configuration.
    
6. It is now connected to the internet, assigned a public IP, and ready for you to use.
    

You see a message: **‚ÄúDeployment Successful‚Äù**  
And the virtual machine appears in your Azure portal dashboard.

Now, from anywhere in the world, you can:

* Connect to that VM
    
* Install software
    
* Host your website
    
* Use it like a real computer
    

### **Let‚Äôs Recap Everything Together:**

* A **data center** is a huge place filled with **physical servers**.
    
* Each server is converted into a **virtualization host** by installing a hypervisor (like Hyper-V).
    
* Using this hypervisor, **dozens or hundreds of virtual machines** are created on a single server.
    
* Each virtual machine is used by a **different customer** ‚Äî for different needs.
    
* Customers don‚Äôt even know which physical machine is being used.
    
* The entire backend process is **automated, optimized, and invisible** to the user.
    
* The front-end (what the customer sees) is the **Azure portal**.
    
* The backend (what actually runs things) is the **physical data center** and hypervisor-managed servers.
    

### **A Real-World Analogy: How Cloud Uses Virtual Machines**

Just like someone can install VMware on their laptop to create virtual machines, cloud providers like Microsoft do something similar at a much larger scale. In their data centers, each physical server runs a hypervisor, which allows them to create hundreds of virtual machines on a single server.

The only difference is the hardware capacity. While a personal laptop might have 16GB of RAM, these servers often have 1024GB (or more) RAM, along with powerful CPUs and large storage.

Each virtual machine is assigned to a different customer and runs in a completely isolated environment. This isolation ensures security and performance. This setup forms the foundation of how cloud computing works behind the scenes.

**üòÆ But Wait ‚Äì A Real Problem in Traditional Virtualization**

Until now, we‚Äôve understood how virtualization works inside a data center ‚Äî how one powerful physical server is converted into a virtualization host and runs many virtual machines (VMs) for different customers using a hypervisor.

But now let‚Äôs talk about a **problem** ‚Äî a limitation that existed **before the cloud revolution** came in.

Let‚Äôs say a company is using a traditional virtualization setup. That means they‚Äôve installed VMware ESXi (Type 1 hypervisor) on all their servers.

So now they have:

* Dozens or even hundreds of virtual machines
    
* All running on different physical hosts
    
* Spread across their internal data center
    

Sounds great so far, right?

But here‚Äôs the catch:

* These virtual machines are **not managed individually**
    
* Instead, all of them are managed using a **central control software** known as **vCenter Server**
    

### **ü§î What is vCenter Server?**

vCenter is like the **master control room** for all VMs created using VMware.

Think of it like:

* The brain of the whole virtual infrastructure
    
* A centralized interface where:
    
    * You can create new VMs
        
    * Monitor existing VMs
        
    * Assign resources
        
    * Delete or restart machines
        
    * Do all VM-related operations
        

In simple words:

‚ÄúvCenter Server is the place from where you can manage the entire virtual data center.‚Äù

### **üö´ But Here Comes the Problem‚Ä¶**

Now imagine this:

You're working in an office, and your data center is either inside the same office building or maybe connected through the company‚Äôs internal network (LAN).

As long as you're inside the building or connected through VPN (Virtual Private Network), you can access vCenter and manage your virtual machines.

But the moment you leave the office ‚Äî let‚Äôs say:

* You travel to **Kuwait**
    
* Or you‚Äôre working from home
    
* Or you're on a holiday in a different city
    

You suddenly realize:

‚ùå You cannot access vCenter from anywhere else!  
‚ùå You can‚Äôt open the vCenter dashboard  
‚ùå You can‚Äôt start or stop a VM  
‚ùå You are stuck!

Why?

Because **vCenter only works inside the company‚Äôs private network**. It is not built for the public internet. It is meant for **on-premise use**.

So now you‚Äôre helpless. You have the knowledge, but you can‚Äôt access your infrastructure.

## **And This Gave Birth to Cloud Portals!**

When Microsoft, Amazon, and other big players saw this problem, they thought:

‚ÄúWhy not build something that people can access from **anywhere in the world**?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not give users a **web-based interface** to manage their virtual machines, without being dependent on internal networks or VPNs?‚Äù

And this thought gave birth to what we now call the **Cloud Control Plane** or simply the **Cloud Portal**.

### **What Did Microsoft Do?**

Microsoft took the concept of virtualization + remote management and created a full-fledged web platform where users could:

* Login from anywhere
    
* Create virtual machines
    
* Manage storage, networks, firewalls
    
* Monitor usage and billing
    
* And never have to worry about internal networks or VPNs again
    

They named this portal:

üîó [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

This website became the **heart of Microsoft Azure's cloud offering**.  
From this portal, you can manage every aspect of your cloud infrastructure ‚Äî just by logging in with your username and password.

## **Azure Portal Is Just Like Zomato**

Now let‚Äôs understand this with a simple, real-world example:

Think about the **Zomato** or **Swiggy** app.

Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. You open the app
    
2. You browse through different restaurants and food items
    
3. You place your order ‚Äî say, **2 plates of Shahi Paneer** or **1 medium pizza**
    
4. The order request goes to the restaurant
    
5. The kitchen starts preparing your order
    
6. Once the food is ready, a delivery partner picks it up
    
7. The food is delivered to your address
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754503268215/c4f41e30-6206-4ce3-9937-8c0898b9d161.png align="center")

You enjoy your meal, but you never:

* Go to the kitchen
    
* See how the food was made
    
* Visit the restaurant physically
    

Everything just works smoothly in the background.

### **Now Replace Zomato with Azure**

This is exactly what **Azure Portal** does with **cloud virtual machines**:

1. You open the Azure Portal website
    
2. You **login** with your credentials
    
3. You click on **Create Virtual Machine**
    
4. You fill in details:
    
    * OS (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
        
    * Size (e.g., DS1 v2 ‚Äì 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
        
    * Region (e.g., Southeast Asia)
        
    * Username and password
        
5. You click **Create**
    

And what happens next?

* Azure sends your VM request to one of its **physical data centers**
    
* It finds a suitable physical host
    
* It launches the **hypervisor**
    
* The hypervisor creates a new **virtual machine** for you
    
* The machine is configured with everything you selected
    
* It is now ready to use
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754503635828/813664b8-6cbf-48e4-8c0c-6e9417d34928.png align="center")

And just like the pizza reaches your doorstep, this virtual machine appears on your Azure dashboard.

You don‚Äôt see the physical machine.  
You don‚Äôt know in which rack or which city your server is hosted.  
You just get a **ready-to-use VM** delivered to you through the internet.

## **Step-by-Step VM Creation Process in Azure**

Let‚Äôs go through the full flow in the order your instructor explained:

1. **Open the Portal**:  
    Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
    
2. **Login**:  
    Enter your Azure account credentials and sign in.
    
3. **Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù ‚Üí Virtual Machine**:  
    Choose the option to create a new VM.
    
4. **Fill Details**:
    
    * Enter the **VM Name** (e.g., deepak-vm)
        
    * Choose **Region** (e.g., Southeast Asia)
        
    * Select **Size** (e.g., DS1 v2 = small size VM)
        
    * Choose the **Operating System** (Windows/Linux)
        
    * Set **Username & Password** for admin access
        
5. **Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù**:
    
    * Azure starts the deployment process
        
6. **Behind the Scenes**:
    
    * Azure picks a data center with available physical resources
        
    * It triggers a **hypervisor** to create a virtual machine
        
    * All configurations are applied
        
    * The machine is started
        
7. **Status is Shown on Screen**:
    
    * ‚ÄúDeployment in Progress‚Äù
        
    * ‚ÄúInitializing Resources‚Äù
        
    * ‚ÄúVM Created Successfully‚Äù
        
8. **VM Appears on Your Dashboard**:  
    You can now connect to your VM via public IP, install applications, and use it just like a real machine.
    

### **Zomato Order vs Azure VM Status**

Let‚Äôs relate Azure's VM deployment to a Zomato order status:

| Zomato Status | Azure Portal Status |
| --- | --- |
| Order received | Request received |
| Food is being prepared | Virtual machine is being configured |
| Packed and out for delivery | VM is being deployed |
| Delivered | VM created and ready to use |

You never see the cooking.  
You never see the real data center.  
But you get your service ‚Äî hot and fresh!

## **Final Thought: Cloud Made Simple**

So this is the **main advantage of cloud portals** like Azure:

* You don‚Äôt need to be in the office
    
* You don‚Äôt need to connect to internal VPNs
    
* You don‚Äôt need to access vCenter or physical hardware
    
* All you need is **internet and a browser**
    
* You get full control of enterprise-grade virtual machines ‚Äî from anywhere in the world
    

That‚Äôs the power of the **Azure Portal**, and that‚Äôs how cloud computing removed the biggest barrier of traditional virtualization.

---

### **üí≠ Let‚Äôs Think Again ‚Äì What Is the Cloud?**

When you use Azure portal to create VMs that are hosted in some remote data center, and you access them using the internet ‚Äî that whole process is called **Cloud Computing**.

"Cloud is someone else‚Äôs computer ‚Äî presented to you as if it‚Äôs your own."

You don‚Äôt own any physical server, but you:

* Use it
    
* Pay for it
    
* Control it via the portal
    

---

### **Wrapping It All Up:**

* A **Physical Server** can only run one OS natively.
    
* With **Virtualization**, we break that limit using a **Hypervisor**.
    
* Hypervisors come in two types:
    
    * **Type 1**: For real cloud (Azure, AWS)
        
    * **Type 2**: For training (VMware Workstation)
        
* You create multiple **Virtual Machines** on one server.
    
* Cloud platforms give you a **web portal (control)** to manage everything.
    
* Microsoft Azure offers this at [`portal.azure.com`](http://portal.azure.com)
    
* Creating a VM is just like ordering pizza on Zomato.
    
* The entire model is **Cloud**.
    

# **IP Addressing & MAC Addressing**

---

## **üì¢ Let‚Äôs Begin with a Simple Idea:**

‚ÄúTo understand how any two machines ‚Äî whether in your home or in Azure ‚Äî communicate with each other, you first need to understand **addresses**. Just like you and I have addresses so people can reach us, computers have addresses so data can reach them.‚Äù

There are **two types of addresses** you must understand before you move ahead with cloud networking:

1. **MAC Address** (Media Access Control) ‚Üí This is the **physical address**
    
2. **IP Address** (Internet Protocol) ‚Üí This is the **logical address**
    

Both work together. You **need both** for a computer or VM to participate in any network, whether it's your home Wi-Fi or Azure cloud infrastructure.

Let‚Äôs dive deep.

## **üîí MAC Address ‚Äì The Physical Identity of Every Device**

The **MAC address** is often called the **hardware address** or **physical address**. It is a **unique identifier** that is burned into your network hardware ‚Äî specifically, into the **NIC (Network Interface Card)**.

Every device that can connect to a network ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a laptop, mobile phone, smart TV, or even your washing machine (if it‚Äôs IoT-enabled) ‚Äî has at least **one NIC**, and **each NIC has a unique MAC address**.

The MAC address is usually written in **12 hexadecimal characters** grouped in pairs, like:

00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

This number is like a permanent name tag for your device in the world of networking.

---

### **üí° Real-Life Analogy:**

‚ÄúThink of a MAC address like your **fingerprint** ‚Äî you are born with it. It‚Äôs unique to you. It‚Äôs not something you change every day.‚Äù

Just like your fingerprint is permanent, a MAC address **does not change** (unless you physically replace your NIC).

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconception: "One Computer = One MAC Address"**

Many people assume that a computer or device has only one MAC address ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not true.

A single device can have **multiple MAC addresses**, depending on the number of network interfaces it has. For example, a laptop with both Wi-Fi and Ethernet capabilities will have one MAC address for the Wi-Fi adapter and a different one for the Ethernet port.

Each network interface ‚Äî whether wired, wireless, or virtual ‚Äî has its own unique MAC address. So, the total number of MAC addresses on a device depends on how many ways it can connect to a network.

Let‚Äôs break this down.

Imagine your laptop or desktop. You might have:

* A **Wi-Fi adapter** to connect wirelessly
    
* An **Ethernet/LAN port** to connect via cable
    
* A **Bluetooth** interface for short-range devices
    
* A **virtual adapter** (e.g., when using a VPN or virtualization software like VMware)
    

Each of these **has its own network interface**, and hence, **its own MAC address**.

So your one laptop might actually have 3‚Äì5 MAC addresses!

| Connection Type | MAC Address |
| --- | --- |
| Wi-Fi | `00:14:22:01:23:45` |
| Ethernet (RJ45) | `20:89:84:5C:9D:F0` |
| Bluetooth | `10:20:30:40:50:60` |
| Virtual Adapter | `DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE` |

So again:

‚ÄúThe **number of MAC addresses** your device has depends on **how many different ways** it can connect to the internet or a network.‚Äù

This is extremely important in real-life IT and cloud scenarios.

---

## **üåê What is an IP Address? ‚Äì Deepest Level of Understanding**

‚ÄúA computer without an IP address is like a house without a name or number. You may live in it, but no one can find it, and you can‚Äôt send anything out from it.‚Äù

So to communicate in any network ‚Äî whether it's a home network, office, or even in Microsoft Azure ‚Äî your machine needs an address that makes it **uniquely identifiable** and reachable. This address is called the **IP address**, or **Internet Protocol address**.

### **üß≠ IP = Logical Address**

The **IP address is a logical address**, meaning it's assigned by software and can be changed as needed. It's not hardcoded like the MAC address.

The **purpose of the IP address** is very clear:

* It is used to **identify** a device in a network.
    
* It is used to **communicate** with other devices.
    
* It is used to **route** data from one machine to another.
    

If there are **100 devices** in a room and only 99 have IP addresses, that **one device without an IP is isolated**, silent, untraceable, and essentially **useless in the network**.

‚ÄúYou can give it RAM, CPU, or even a powerful OS ‚Äî but if it doesn‚Äôt have an IP, it‚Äôs dead to the network.‚Äù

This applies to:

* Your laptop
    
* Your mobile phone
    
* Your smart TV
    
* And even your **virtual machines on Azure**
    

## **üî¢ Understanding IPv4 ‚Äì The Most Common IP Version**

There are two versions of IP addresses:

1. IPv4 (Version 4)
    
2. IPv6 (Version 6)
    

But in most networks and in Azure, **IPv4** is still the most commonly used. So the instructor focused deeply on this version first.

### **üìò IPv4 Format ‚Äì The 32-Bit Number**

The IPv4 address is a **32-bit** address. But because humans find it hard to read 32 binary digits, it is shown in a simpler format called **Dotted Decimal Notation**.

So a 32-bit IP address is shown like this:

192.168.1.1

Each group separated by a dot is called an **octet**, and it contains **8 bits**.

So:

* First octet: 192 ‚Üí 8 bits
    
* Second: 168 ‚Üí 8 bits
    
* Third: 1 ‚Üí 8 bits
    
* Fourth: 1 ‚Üí 8 bits
    

‚Üí Total = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = **32 bits**

This is the format that everyone is familiar with when they open the command prompt and type `ipconfig`.

## **Range of Each Octet**

Each of the 4 octets can store any number from **0 to 255**, because 8 bits can represent 256 values.

So your full IPv4 address can range from:

0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

But remember ‚Äî **not all IP addresses are usable**. Some are reserved (we‚Äôll see soon), and some are used for testing, broadcasting, or other special purposes.

## **Why Is Each Part Called an Octet?**

‚ÄúThe word *Octet* comes from the Greek root ‚Äòocto‚Äô, which means **eight**. That‚Äôs why October used to be the 8th month in the old calendar. In IP addresses, each group has 8 bits ‚Äî hence it is called an **octet**.‚Äù

This simple idea helps you remember:

"Each IP address = 4 octets = 32 bits."

## **IP Address Classification ‚Äì What Are IP Classes?**

Not all IPs are created equal. Based on the **first octet**, IP addresses are divided into **five major classes** ‚Äî each designed for a different type of network.

‚ÄúA large company like Reliance may need lakhs of IPs. A small shop may need just 2. So IPs were divided into classes based on the size of the network they serve.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs understand these five classes:

### **All 5 Classes of IP Addresses**

| Class | First Octet Range | Who Uses It | Devices Per Network |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 0 ‚Äì 127 | Very large organizations | ~16 million |
| B | 128 ‚Äì 191 | Medium-sized companies | ~65,000 |
| C | 192 ‚Äì 223 | Small companies / homes | 254 |
| D | 224 ‚Äì 239 | Multicasting / IPTV | Not for device allocation |
| E | 240 ‚Äì 255 | Experimental / R&D | Reserved only |

Each class offers a different **number of host addresses**.

### **‚ùó Important Notes:**

* **Class A** begins from 0 to 127 ‚Äî but :
    
    * `0.x.x.x` is **reserved**
        
    * `127.x.x.x` is used for **loopback testing**
        

So **Class A usable range** is actually:

1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255

## **üîÅ Loopback Address ‚Äì Ping Yourself!**

‚ÄúWant to test if your network card is working? Just talk to yourself ‚Äî your own machine.‚Äù

Use the **loopback IP**:

127.0.0.1

This is called the [**localhost**](http://localhost) address.

Try this:

1. Open CMD (Command Prompt)
    
2. Type ping 127.0.0.1
    
3. Press Enter
    

You‚Äôll see ping replies.  
This means your **network card is active** ‚Äî you are talking to your own machine.

This trick is commonly used to **test internal connectivity**.

## **Binary and Decimal Representation**

Now comes the twist ‚Äî **computers don‚Äôt understand decimals**. Internally, they only work in **binary** (0s and 1s).

So, while you see:

192.168.0.1

The computer sees:

11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001

Here's how:

* 192 ‚Üí 11000000
    
* 168 ‚Üí 10101000
    
* 0 ‚Üí 00000000
    
* 1 ‚Üí 00000001
    

# **The History of IP Addressing ‚Äì A Story from the Beginning**

---

### **üìçWhy is it important to know the history?**

IP addresses are used everywhere ‚Äî at home, in schools, in data centers, and in cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. Despite being such an essential part of our digital lives, very few people understand where this system originated.

Understanding the history behind IP addressing helps us appreciate its purpose and how it has shaped the internet we use today. Before depending on something for a lifetime, it‚Äôs valuable to know how and why it was created.

So, let‚Äôs take a quick journey into the past to see how IP addressing started and how it became the backbone of modern communication over the internet.

## **üï∞Ô∏è Let‚Äôs Travel Back to the 1960s and 1970s**

Back then, **the internet didn‚Äôt exist**.

Yes ‚Äî there was no Google, no websites, no YouTube, not even emails as we know them.

But scientists, researchers, and especially **military organizations** in the **United States** were trying to build a way for computers to **talk to each other**.

Their aim was to:

* **Send files** from one university to another
    
* **Communicate** between military computers
    
* Share information **even if one location was destroyed**
    

Why? Because this was the time of the **Cold War**, and the U.S. military wanted a network that would **continue to work even during war or disaster**.

So they funded a research project called **ARPANET**.

## **ARPANET ‚Äì The First Internet**

ARPANET stands for:

**Advanced Research Projects Agency Network**

It was the **first successful packet-switching network**, and it is considered the **grandfather of the modern internet**.

This project was funded by an agency called **DARPA** (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), which was part of the U.S. Department of Defense.

### **But There Was One Big Problem‚Ä¶**

As more and more computers were being added to this early network, there was **no standard system** for identifying which computer was which.

Think about it:

* You have 10 computers.
    
* You want to send a message to computer #7.
    
* But how do you know which is #7?
    

There was **no concept of an IP address** at the time.  
They tried using host names and simple numbers, but it quickly became messy and unmanageable.

‚ÄúImagine 1000 computers in a network and no house numbers ‚Äî chaos!‚Äù

So they needed a **standard way** to assign addresses to every computer ‚Äî something that could:

* Identify each machine uniquely
    
* Help in sending and receiving messages
    
* Be understood by all systems
    

## **The Birth of IP Addressing (1981)**

Finally, after years of research, in the year **1981**, a formal document was published.

This document was called:

**RFC 791**

### **üìñ What is an RFC?**

‚ÄúRFC stands for **Request For Comments**. It‚Äôs a type of public technical document where internet engineers publish their ideas and standards.‚Äù

When an RFC becomes widely accepted, it becomes the **standard rule** for the internet.

So **RFC 791** was the official document that **introduced and defined IPv4** ‚Äî the Internet Protocol version 4 ‚Äî which is still the most used version of IP addressing today.

### **üìò What Did RFC 791 Contain?**

RFC 791 introduced:

* The **format** of IP addresses (32-bit, divided into 4 octets)
    
* The idea of **logical addressing**
    
* The use of IP addresses in **routing**
    
* The difference between **host** and **network**
    
* The need for **classes of IPs** (A, B, C, D, E)
    

This document laid the **blueprint** of how devices would talk to each other over the internet.

Even today, when we assign an IP like `192.168.0.1`, we are following the **rules written in RFC 791** back in 1981!

### **What Was India Doing at That Time?**

Back in 1981, while countries like the United States were developing the foundations of the internet ‚Äî defining IP addresses and building early email systems ‚Äî India was in a very different stage of technological growth. Color televisions were just becoming popular, and most universities had limited or no access to computers.

Although India joined the digital revolution later, it has since made remarkable progress. Today, the country is playing a major role in global technology and innovation.

This contrast highlights the long-term vision of the early internet pioneers. The systems they designed over 40 years ago are still powering the internet today ‚Äî a true example of forward-thinking design.

## **Why IPv4 Still Works Today**

Now, here‚Äôs the amazing part ‚Äî even though IPv4 was created in 1981, it is:

* Still in use today
    
* Still supported by every router, server, cloud platform
    
* Still fast enough and flexible enough for most networks
    

That‚Äôs the power of **designing a system ahead of its time**.

But as the number of devices grew (think billions of smartphones, IoT devices, cloud servers), the number of available IPv4 addresses started running out.

This led to the development of **IPv6**, which provides **340 undecillion addresses** (that‚Äôs a number with 36 zeros).

## **And What About IPv5?**

* A common question that comes up is: *Why was IPv5 skipped? Why did we go directly from IPv4 to IPv6?*
    
* The answer lies in the fact that IPv5 did exist, but it was never meant for public or large-scale use. It was developed as an experimental protocol designed specifically for streaming and real-time communication. However, it was never completed or standardized.
    
* More importantly, IPv5 did not address the growing problem of IP address exhaustion ‚Äî one of the major reasons for developing a new protocol. As a result, IPv5 was eventually abandoned.
    
* That‚Äôs why the world moved forward with IPv6, which was built to handle the limitations of IPv4 and meet the future demands of the internet.
    

## **Summary of the History of IP**

| Timeline | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 1960s‚Äì70s | U.S. military and universities created **ARPANET**, the first internet-like network |
| 1981 | **DARPA** publishes **RFC 791**, introducing IPv4 |
| 1981‚ÄìNow | IPv4 becomes the standard for all internet communication |
| Early 1990s | IPv5 is designed for multimedia, but dropped later |
| Late 1990s‚Äì2000s | IPv6 is developed to solve address shortages |
| Today | IPv4 is still widely used; IPv6 adoption is growing fast |

## **Why This Matters for Cloud and Azure?**

Everything in Azure (or AWS, or GCP) depends on **IP addresses**.

* When you create a virtual machine, Azure gives it an IP.
    
* When your app connects to a database, it needs the IP.
    
* When you SSH into a VM, you're using its IP.
    
* When you load a website hosted in Azure ‚Äî again, you‚Äôre routing through IP addresses.
    

‚ÄúEven though you're studying cloud, if you don‚Äôt understand IP, you're just pressing buttons ‚Äî not actually learning how it all works.‚Äù
